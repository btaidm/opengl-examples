You can typically install ImageMagick using the package manager in
your Linux distribution or homebrew for OSX. Ghostscript is also
required for fonts to work on OSX. Simply search for packages that
include the word "magick" and install any packages that look like
they are related to the ImageMagick MagickCore library.

On Ubuntu 14.04, try installing the following two packages (and the
packages that they depend on):
imagemagick
libmagickcore-dev

If you need to compile ImageMagick yourself:

1) Download the ImageMagick source file and extract the files

2) cd into the ImageMagick directory.

3) Run "./configure"

4) If configure fails, it will probably complain about one or more
missing libraries. Install those libraries and try running configure
again.

5) Run "make"

6a) If you are administrator and want to install the library into
/usr/local/ on your system, run "sudo make install"

6b) If you aren't administrator and/or don't want to install the
library onto your system, open CMakeLists.txt. Look for where
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH and CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH are set in the area of the
file that involves ImageMagick. You can add additional lines to tell
cmake where your copy of ImageMagick is installed.
