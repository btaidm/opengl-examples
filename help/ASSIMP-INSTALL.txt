ASSIMP 3.0 is available in the Ubuntu 14.04 package manager as well as
homebrew for OSX. It is sufficient for most purposes. If you are
trying to use ASSIMP for the first time, I recommend that you try this
easy option before trying to download and compile the latest
version. On many systems, you will need to install both the library
and the associated headers (for example libassimp3 and libassimp-dev).

If you are encountering problems are loading lots of 3D models,
getting the latest version (3.1.1, at the current time of writing) may
be useful. The most noticeable change in ASSIMP 3.1.1 is that it
improves how models are scaled when they are loaded.

To compile it yourself, download a copy:
http://assimp.sourceforge.net/

Run "cmake ."
Run "make"
Run "make install" to install files into /usr/local

To make sure that cmake finds your copy of the library, run
"./cleanup.sh" to clean up all of the binaries and CMake cache files
from your opengl-examples directory. Then run "cmake ." and "make" to
compile with ASSIMP. If CMake doesn't find your copy of the ASSIMP
library, you may need to edit CMakeLists.txt in the opengl-examples
directory.
