ASSIMP 3.0 is available in the Ubuntu 14.04 package manager as well as
homebrew for OSX. It is sufficient for most purposes. If you are
trying to use ASSIMP for the first time, I recommend that you try this
easy option before trying to download and compile the latest version.

If you are encountering problems are loading lots of 3D models,
getting the latest version (3.1.1, at the current time of writing) may
be useful. I have run across at least two issues in ASSIMIP 3.0 that
is resolved in ASSIMP 3.1.1. One of the problems that is unresolved in
3.0 but resolved in 3.1 is that models created in Sketchup in meters
are actually in inches when loaded by ASSIMP. The newest version
correctly loads these models with units in meters.

To compile it yourself, download a copy:
http://assimp.sourceforge.net/

Run "cmake ."
Run "make"
Run "make install" to install files into /usr/local

To make sure that cmake finds your copy of the library, run
"./cleanup.sh" to clean up all of the binaries and CMake cache files
from your opengl-examples directory. Then run "cmake ." and "make" to
compile with ASSIMP. If CMake doesn't find your copy of the ASSIMP
library, you may need to edit CMakeLists.txt in the opengl-examples
directory.
