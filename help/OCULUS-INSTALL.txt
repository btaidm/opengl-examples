Linux support for Oculus Rift is still considered experimental, and must be
compiled from source. You will need to be on a computer that you have root
access to.
 
=== Installation ===
1. Download the Linux Oculus SDK from https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/
2. Extract the contents using "tar -xf ovr_sdk_linux*.tar.xz"
3. If you are on a Debian or Ubuntu machine, run "sudo ./ConfigureDebian.sh"

    If you are not on a Debian/Ubuntu machine, you can open the script
    in a text editor and note the packages that it installs via
    apt-get. You may need to install similar packages on your system
    to get the library to compile. You may also need administrator
    access to install a udev-related file onto your system.

4. Run "make". On at least one computer, I had to remove -Werror from
one or more makefiles to get the compiler. (The -Werror option tells
the compiler to treat warnings the same way as it does error)

5. Run "./oculusd" to start the Oculus daemon. If you want to run the
script in the background, run "./oculusd -d". You can see if it is
running by using the command "ps aux | grep oculusd".

=== Running a sample program ===
The Oculus driver comes with a sample program in the "Sample" folder. You can use that to confirm that LibOVR can successfully communicate with your HMD.

=== Oculus Configuration ===
You do not necessarily have to perform this step to use your HMD.

1. Make sure oculusd is running.
2. Run "cd ConfigUtil"
3. Run "./RiftConfigUtil"
4. If it gives an error message, you may need to modify permissions of the 
   Resources directory and its contents before being able to run the utility.
