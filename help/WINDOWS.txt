Windows Installation:

Setup:
Install 7Zip
Install Git
	Avoid installing the git-cheetah plugin if you can. It messes with your path environment variable.
Install CMake
Install MinGW
Install DirectX SDK

Modify Environment:
To modify your environment variables: http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm
You'll need to modify your PATH environment variable as such. The order IS important.
	<path_to_mingw_installation>\bin;<path_to_mingw_installation>\msys\1.0\bin;<path_to_cmake_installation>\bin;<path_to_git_installation>\bin;<ORIGINAL_PATH_VARIABLE>
You may need to set the DXSDK_DIR environment variable to the directory you installed in. This is so ASSIMP can compile its tools.
	Example: D:\Env\Libraries\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)\
	
Installing Libraries:
Create a folder where you'd like libraries to be installed (ex: C:\Libraries)
Open Windows.cmake and edit the WINDOWS_LIBRARY_PATH variable to match the libraries folder you created.
Open Windows command line in opengl-examples by holding shit, right clicking in the folder, and selecting "Open Command Window Here".
Run wininstall.bat
It will prompt you for folder paths. Make sure they are fully qualified paths (i.e. D:\Env\Libraries\ and D:\Env\MinGW\)
It's important that the path arguments you provide use \ instead of / and have a \ at the end of each path.

Compiling:
To build opengl-examples:
Run cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" .
Run mingw32-make
