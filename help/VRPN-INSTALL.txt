VRPN is probably not in any common Linux package managers. However, it
is available in homebrew on OSX.

To install, follow these steps:

wget 'http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/vrpn/downloads/vrpn_07_31.zip'
unzip vrpn_07_31.zip
cd vrpn
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DVRPN_GPL_SERVER=1 ..
make

OPTIONAL: If you have root access to the machine and want to install
the library and include files into /usr/local so that cmake can easily
find them. run:

cd vrpn/build
sudo make install

If you do NOT follow the optional step above, you must modify
CMakeLists.txt to tell it where your copy of VRPN is.

----

The exiting CMakeLists.txt should find VRPN on IVS. If VRPN ever needs
to be recompiled on IVS, we found that this command works:

cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++ -DVRPN_BUILD_PYTHON= -DVRPN_BUILD_PYTHON_HANDCODED_2X= .
