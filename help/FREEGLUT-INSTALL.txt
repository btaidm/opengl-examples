Freeglut is available in package managers for many Linux
distributions. Even if you have freeglut installed, cmake may require
that you also have some X development libraries installed to.

For example, on Ubuntu 14.04, you may need to install these packages:
libxmu-dev
libxi-dev
freeglut3-dev

On OSX, the glut included with XCode should be sufficient.
