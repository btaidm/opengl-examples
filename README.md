OpenGL examples
===============

These example programs demonstrate how to develop OpenGL 3.0 programs on multiple platforms. This code is heavily tested on Linux but also has been known to work on OSX and on Windows (through MingW). This project relies on several different libraries to read & write images, read 3D model files, communicate with VRPN tracking systems, red/cyan anaglyph stereoscopy, head-mounted display support (including Oculus DK1 & DK2), and multi-host distributed rendering.

This software has been primarily developed at Michigan Technological University for use in advanced computer graphics courses and for virtual reality research projects.

See the "help" folder for basic information about compiling and running this software.
