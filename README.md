OpenGL examples
===============

These example programs demonstrate how to develop OpenGL 3.0 programs on Linux. This codebase relies on several different libraries to allow loading images and 3D model files from a variety of different files, communication with VRPN tracking systems, red/cyan anaglyph stereoscopy, head-mounted display support (including Oculus DK1 & DK2), and multi-host distributed rendering.

This software has been primarily developed at Michigan Technological University for use in advanced computer graphics courses and for virtual reality research projects.

See the "help" folder for basic information about compiling and running this software.
